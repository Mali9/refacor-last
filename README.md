1- the code is ok it use the repository pattern .
every model has it's own repository and all shared  common methods like (get , find , where ..etc) 
so it's a good way to use the repository pattern with it and all extend from the BaseRepository that contain all shared methods and every repo has extend from it plus it's diffrent own functionallity .
it use dependy injection in every where and that's a good way to use a Singlton Pattern with a single object .

2- there a something is wrong here or not ok the BookingControll is responsibile for many things not only booking functionallity for example .



   public function resendNotifications(Request $request)
    {
        $data = $request->all();
        $job = $this->repository->find($data['jobid']);
        $job_data = $this->repository->jobToData($job);
        $this->repository->sendNotificationTranslator($job, $job_data, '*');

        return response(['success' => 'Push sent']);
    }

    
sending notification is not responsibility for BookingControll it must be in another service so here  
"We did not achieve the single responsibility principle"



3- here we did not achieve the open/closed principle 

    public function resendNotifications(Request $request)
    {
        $data = $request->all();
        $job = $this->repository->find($data['jobid']);
        $job_data = $this->repository->jobToData($job);
        $this->repository->sendNotificationTranslator($job, $job_data, '*');

        return response(['success' => 'Push sent']);
    }

    /**
     * Sends SMS to Translator
     * @param Request $request
     * @return \Illuminate\Contracts\Routing\ResponseFactory|\Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response
     */
    public function resendSMSNotifications(Request $request)
    {
        $data = $request->all();
        $job = $this->repository->find($data['jobid']);
        $job_data = $this->repository->jobToData($job);

        try {
            $this->repository->sendSMSNotificationToTranslator($job);
            return response(['success' => 'SMS sent']);
        } catch (\Exception $e) {
            return response(['success' => $e->getMessage()]);
        }
    }


we must make a interface then every sms and notification and another sending methods implement it 
i alreeady make it in refactoring the code
so we can achieve SOLID principles in this case





Refactoring 
1- Request $request  i change it because we should use a Request for every model like BookingRequest that contain every things a about the equest like rules and authorization and so on.

2- i change all $request->all();  to $request->validated(); for security reasons we shouldn't take all request like this first we should validate it then take the validated data $request->validated();

3- i refactor sending notifications .
we have to methods to send notification (sms and notification) .
i have created interface and create service for every method then implement sendNotification methods for all
this solution will resolve opend/closed and liskove pattern .
then bind ther serivces with the interface in AppServiceProvider

4- i used dependy injection in every where i can use
